The courses on GFG are well structured. I enrolled in DSA DA and SDE theory. The way of explanation by the teachers is awesome. First I took the course in which Sandeep Jain (Founder of Geeks For Geeks) sir was the mentor. The course was really nice and it helps in knowing how we can figure out different solutions for other problems and every approach is explained from Brute force to optimal. The cost is really student-friendly and it is sure we are going to learn more than what we have paid.

I have a basic command in Algorithms and data structures but there was a lack of confidence while solving the problems. Before the course, I was practicing but not able to understand the topic in every aspect. With the help of the course and instructors teaching I successfully understand the core concepts and was able to apply them to solve related problems on my own. After practicing a bit more I successfully cracked many interviews and gained confidence in my coding skills. I am very grateful to the GFG team and their quality content.

I am thrilled to share my success with GeeksforGeeks (GFG), which played a pivotal role in my GATE DA 2024 achievement. I have secured AIR 951 despite not having a Strong CS background. GFG's Doubt Classes were invaluable, offering personalized assistance whenever needed. Their in-depth syllabus coverage ensured a strong conceptual understanding, while the abundance of practice problems sharpened my problem solving skills effectively. Despite offering top-notch resources and high quality, GFG charges very less fees so that it does not become a burden for any of students. I, Anant Om, highly recommend GFG to anyone aiming for GATE DA.
